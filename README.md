OwlImages
===========
OwlImages is an image hosting service using Express on the server side and Angular on the client side. The name is derived from the former host _WaffleImages_ created by [Something Awful](http://somethingawful.com) and [TeamLiquid](http://teamliquid.net) superstar R1ch.

Most development will be server-side to start. User-centric features may take a backseat as this is mostly being developed as an anonymous/single uploader service.
More information coming soon.
